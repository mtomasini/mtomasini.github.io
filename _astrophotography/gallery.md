After more than two years as a visual observer, I realized that observation from a light polluted city is generally limited. While I do enjoy observing the planets and the Moon, as well as the brightest Deep Sky Objects, the view from my balcony is often bare, with few object to really capture my ongoing interest. Due to these limitations, I started to undertake astrophotography, which allows me to tackle more projects and to see fainter objects without having to drive hours away from the city. 

Keep in mind that these pictures are taken as a beginner in the hobby, and using the modest equipment that I have at hand. I do not intend to splurge right away in the hobby, and more advanced pieces of equipment will come according to what I can afford. The goal of this gallery is to remind my future self of the efforts to reach these modest pictures.

Here is a note about my equipment.
- Telescope: SkyWatcher Skymax 127 (Maksutov design)
- Mount: AZ-GTi (in AZ mode!)
- Camera: Sony Alpha 55
