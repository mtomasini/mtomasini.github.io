> "[...] ils se moquaient souvent de ce que je voulais le savoir [...]. Mais, malgré ce désespoir, je ne laisse pas de désirer d'être instruit, et ma curiosité trompée est toujours insatiable." (Voltaire, Le philosophe ignorant[^1])

Welcome to my website! I am a postdoc at the University of Gothenburg. In my work, I use mathematical modelling, simulations, and statistical methods to study population genetics in a spatial context, in particular in the marine environment. The ultimate goal is to use such methods to understand the influence of spatio-temporal factors on the evolution of genetic patterns.

I did my PhD in population genetics at University of Bern, where I completed my thesis on rapid adaptation in the presence of gene flow.

Ever since my youth I have been curious and interested in all domains of knowledge. After studying ancient Greek and Latin in high school, I studied theoretical physics at the University of Geneva, before completely switching topic and falling in love with evolutionary biology. To this day I find all domains of knowledge fascinating and I have interests for the most disparate fields, such as social sciences and the humanities.

Because of personal and professional interest, I have recently become more involved with activities aiming to highlight the importance of good software and programming practices in biology and in science in general. In the future, I am aiming to continue my career in a position akin to research software engineering, building and supporting scientific software for a more sustainable use of computational tools in my field.
