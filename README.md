# Powered by Minimal Mistakes remote theme starter

I used Minimal Mistakes to power my website on Github. I like it a lot. I don't understand all of it, but then again, I'm just an enthusiast, not a front-end developer.

Click [**Use this template**](https://github.com/mmistakes/mm-github-pages-starter/generate) button above for the quickest method of getting started with the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll theme](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes).

That's good stuff...!
