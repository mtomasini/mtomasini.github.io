### Maritime encounters and ancient navigation

Currently, I am mainly concerned with navigation during the Scandinavian Bronze Age. Using agent-based simulations, my collaborators and I are attempting to establish likely navigation routes that allowed Scandinavian populations to maintain a large and vibrant trade network. We merge modern climatological data with engineering considerations about boat building to model what were the navigation possibilities 3000 years ago. In addition, I contribute to the interpretation of results, as well as taking part to workshops and field experiments to test different ancient navigation possibilities. This led me to develop a strong interest in the building and navigation of logboats, in collaboration with the French association [Koruc](https://www.koruc.org/).

On the side of Maritime Encounters, I borrow from my personal passion for visual astronomy to think about cultural astronomy -- _e.g._ the study of how humans saw and thought of the starry sky through history. An interesting question related to navigation in the Bronze Age regards astronomical methods of navigation: did Scandinavian populations navigating between 3400 and 1400 BC years ago use any stars beyond the Sun for orientation? We know from multiple sources that astronomical knowledge at the time was advanced: for example, in Hesiod we find references to astral farmer almanacs in the form of heliacal risings that were taken for granted in 700BC, and we find possible traces of similar knowledge way before then in the megalithic temples in Malta (M. Hoskin, 2001). If you have any interest in these topics, and want to incorporate digital components to it, reach out!

### Digital humanities

My department at the University of Gothenburg specializes among other things in the visualization of historical data in space and time. Currently, I am involved in the creation of a portal to visualize different types of documentations (images, documents, 3D models) of Etruscan tombs. While I am mostly responsible for the development of the backend and the database, I am slowly learning a few principles in frontend development as well.

Related to my job, in my own time I have recently picked up again the study of ancient Greek, which I had undertaken during high school. While my current major interest is in ancient history, I harbor a deep passion for all subjects related to the humanities - and all of science in general.

### InfraVis

Through my position at GRIDH, I am employed 25% in [InfraVis](https://infravis.se/), a Swedish national research infrastructure supporting scientific advancement through the application of state-of-the-art data analysis and visualization techniques. I am currently involved in a collaboration with the Ditigal Twin City Center of Gothenburg, and will develop further research projects within the infrastructure. Stay tuned!


### Addendum: Evolutionary biology

Before getting into digital humanities, I built an academic career studying population genetics, which can be considered as the mathematical theory upon which theoretical evolutionary biology is built. In my 8 years in the field (PhD and two postdocs contracts) I worked on different topics: in particular _evolutionary rescue_, _isolation by distance_ and _range expansions_. Evolutionary rescue refers to when a population (loosely defined as a group of individuals exchanging genetic material) facing extinction survives due to a new beneficial mutation spreading in the population. Isolation by distance refers to a genetic pattern that can be seen when observing the individual DNAs of many different individuals of a population spread over a large territory: in general, one would expect that the farther away two indivduals can be found, the more genetic differences their genomes will harbor between themselves. Finally, range expansions occur when a population expands over a territory: this causes genetic changes at the front of the population expansion that we can quantify and study.

I don't consider myself a biologist anymore, but I will always harbor a deep interest for these topics.
