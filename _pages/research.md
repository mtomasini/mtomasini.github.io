### Maritime encounters and ancient navigation

As part of the Gothenburg Research Infrastructure in Digital Humanities (GRIDH), I lend my knowledge of agent-based modelling to the Maritime Encounters project, which aims at studying the importance of the sea for the social fabric during the Scandinavian Bronze Age (1700-500 BC) and earlier. My collaborators and I are attempting to establish likely navigation routes that allowed Scandinavian populations to maintain a large and vibrant trade network. We merge modern climatological data with engineering considerations about boat building to model what were the navigation possibilities up to 4000 years ago. Additionally, I contribute to the interpretation of results, and - in a twist of my destiny as a theoretician - I take part in field experiments to test the performance of boats built using ancient methods (such as skin boats and logboats).

### Digital humanities

My department at the University of Gothenburg specializes in the visualization of historical and cultural heritage data in space and time. I am actively one of the developers behind the Multimodal Map tool developed at GRIDH, which was used to build - among other things - the [Etruscan Chamber Tombs portal](https://etruscan.dh.gu.se), a portal for the exploration of visual data collected in and around the Etruscan tombs in San Giovenale, Italy. Currently, I am mostly responsible for the development of the backend and the database, while I am slowly learning a few principles in frontend development as well. I am also being formed in documentation techniques, especially 3D digitization techniques. Finally, I am collaborating in a project that is attempting to analyse the soundtracks in conspiracy movies.

Additionally to my institutional tasks, I am still developing my personal research interests. One of my biggest interests is visual astronomy, and I am especially interested in research topics going from star navigation in ancient times to the history of modern astronomy. One aspect that I am particularly passioned about is the rise of light pollution and its impacts not only on the biosphere, but on humans' sense of wonder. If you have any interest in these topics, and want to incorporate digital components to it, reach out!

### InfraVis

Through my position at GRIDH, I am employed 25% in [InfraVis](https://infravis.se/), a Swedish national research infrastructure supporting scientific advancement through the application of state-of-the-art data analysis and visualization techniques. I am currently involved in several research projects within the infrastructure, where I serve as a software engineer. Stay tuned!

### Addendum: Evolutionary biology

Before getting into digital humanities, I built an academic career studying population genetics, which can be considered as the mathematical theory upon which theoretical evolutionary biology is built. In my 8 years in the field (PhD and two postdocs contracts) I worked on different topics: in particular _evolutionary rescue_, _isolation by distance_ and _range expansions_. Evolutionary rescue refers to when a population (loosely defined as a group of individuals exchanging genetic material) facing extinction survives due to a new beneficial mutation spreading in the population. Isolation by distance refers to a genetic pattern that can be seen when observing the individual DNAs of many different individuals of a population spread over a large territory: in general, one would expect that the farther away two indivduals can be found, the more genetic differences their genomes will harbor between themselves. Finally, range expansions occur when a population expands over a territory: this causes genetic changes at the front of the population expansion that we can quantify and study.

I don't consider myself a biologist anymore, but I will always harbor a deep interest for these topics.
