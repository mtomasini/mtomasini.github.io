#### Inferring patterns of isolation by distance
An important issue in different biological applications (here I am thinking in particular of conservation studies) is to correctly measure parameters such as the population density and the dispersal rate of a population. However, this is often not doable in practice: on one hand, it can be impossible to sample or even observe all the individuals of a species, and on the second hand, unless we are in possess of historical demographic data, it is difficult to infer if a sampled individual is originally from the sampling area or if it was the result of a long distance migration event.
Isolation by distance refers to the accrual of genetic differentiation with distance within members of a population. It is a relatively easy pattern to measure. Different models to connect isolation by distance to different population parameters exist, but they are often simplified models, e.g. developed within a stepping stone model. I am developing a method to infer the hard-to-measure population parameters from patterns of isolation by distance in continuous space.

#### Establishment of locally adapted mutations in a spatial context
We studied the establishment probabilities of locally adapted mutations using a multi-type branching process framework. The result was a surprisingly simple and intuitive analytical approximation for the establishment probabilities in a symmetric two-deme model under the assumption of weak (positive) selection. This was the first analytical closed-form approximation for arbitrary migration rate to appear in the literature.
This work generalized the result by Haldane (1927) for the probability of fixation of a beneficial mutation in a population. Our model allows for asymmetric migration rates between the two demes of the habitat, and even for asymmetric carrying capacities – allowing us to illustrate how density regulation can affect establishment probabilities.  Finally, we used our results to investigate the role of gene flow on the rate of local adaptation and identify cases in which intermediate amounts of gene flow facilitate the rate of local adaptation as compared to two populations without gene flow.

#### Effects of gene flow and spatial structure on evolutionary rescue
Recent experimental and theoretical studies have highlighted the influence of migration on the probability of evolutionary rescue in structured habitats. Theoretical modelling of a structured population experiencing strong environmental change showed that intermediate migration rates maximize the probability of rescue. Experiments have shown that gene-flow between sub-populations generally increases the probability of rescue of a population at risk of extinction. Using our results from Tomasini & Peischl (2018), we developed an analytically tractable model to study evolutionary rescue in two-demes. This model allows us to find conditions leading to maximal probabilities of rescue for intermediate migration. The simplicity of the model makes it suited to study evolutionary rescue in an island model, and – with some adjustements – in a stepping stone model.

We extended the study of evolutionary rescue to habitats subdivided in more than just two subpopulations, in order to understand how gene flow is affected by habitat fragmentation and structure. We compared evolutionary rescue in an island model – where there is no spatial structure – and in a stepping stone model. We were able to show that different rates of migration should favor evolutionary rescue in the two models. [pdf on [bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.29.360842v2.full.pdf)]
