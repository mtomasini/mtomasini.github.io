### Maritime encounters
Currently, I am mainly concerned with navigation during the Scandinavian Bronze Age. Using agent-based simulations, my collaborators and I are attempting to establish likely navigation routes that allowed Scandinavian populations to maintain a large and vibrant trade network. We merge modern climatological data with engineering considerations about boat building to model what were the navigation possibilities 3000 years ago. 

Coming from a landlocked country, I have a deep interest for anything that has to do with the sea, and it's a privilege to be able to study the interactions of old civilizations with water. 

### Digital humanities
I am in the process of discovering what my long term role will be my new field. Stay tuned to hear more about my interests!

### Evolutionary biology
Before getting into digital humanities, I built an academic career studying population genetics, which can be considered as the mathematical theory upon which theoretical evolutionary biology is built. In my 8 years in the field (PhD and two postdocs contracts) I worked on different topics: in particular _evolutionary rescue_, _isolation by distance_ and _range expansions_. Evolutionary rescue refers to when a population (loosely defined as a group of individuals exchanging genetic material) facing extinction survives due to a new beneficial mutation spreading in the population. Isolation by distance refers to a genetic pattern that can be seen when observing the individual DNAs of many different individuals of a population spread over a large territory: in general, one would expect that the farther away two indivduals can be found, the more genetic differences their genomes will harbor between themselves. Finally, range expansions occur when a population expands over a territory: this causes genetic changes at the front of the population expansion that we can quantify and study. 

I don't consider myself a biologist anymore, but I will always harbor a deep interest for these topics.
