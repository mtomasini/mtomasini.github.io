### Maritime encounters

Currently, I am mainly concerned with navigation during the Scandinavian Bronze Age. Using agent-based simulations, my collaborators and I are attempting to establish likely navigation routes that allowed Scandinavian populations to maintain a large and vibrant trade network. We merge modern climatological data with engineering considerations about boat building to model what were the navigation possibilities 3000 years ago. In addition, I contribute to the interpretation of results as well as taking part to workshops and field experiments to test different ancient navigation possibilities.

Coming from a landlocked country, I have a deep interest for anything that has to do with the sea, and it's a privilege to be able to study the interactions of old civilizations with water.

### InfraVis

Through my position at GRIDH, I am employed 25% in [InfraVis](https://infravis.se/), a Swedish national research infrastructure supporting scientific advancement through the application of state-of-the-art data analysis and visualization techniques. I only recently joined InfraVis, so I don't have much to say yet, but stay tuned!

### Miscellaneous

Being relatively new in digital humanities, I have not had the time to develop my full profile in the field. Currently, my main interests lie in archaeological and historical projects, in particular when they concern ancient history. In my own time I have recently picked up again the study of ancient Greek, and because of personal interests I have been reading avidly about ethno-/cultural astronomy. An interesting question related to navigation in the Bronze Age regards astronomical methods of navigation: did Scandinavian populations navigating between 3400 and 1400 BC years ago use any stars beyond the Sun for orientation? We know from multiple sources that astronomical knowledge at the time was advanced: for example, in Hesiod we find references to astral farmer almanacs in the form of heliacal risings that were taken for granted in 700BC, and we find possible traces of similar knowledge way before then in the megalithic temples in Malta (M. Hoskin, 2001). If you have any interest in these topics, and want to incorporate digital components to it, reach out!

### Addendum: Evolutionary biology

Before getting into digital humanities, I built an academic career studying population genetics, which can be considered as the mathematical theory upon which theoretical evolutionary biology is built. In my 8 years in the field (PhD and two postdocs contracts) I worked on different topics: in particular _evolutionary rescue_, _isolation by distance_ and _range expansions_. Evolutionary rescue refers to when a population (loosely defined as a group of individuals exchanging genetic material) facing extinction survives due to a new beneficial mutation spreading in the population. Isolation by distance refers to a genetic pattern that can be seen when observing the individual DNAs of many different individuals of a population spread over a large territory: in general, one would expect that the farther away two indivduals can be found, the more genetic differences their genomes will harbor between themselves. Finally, range expansions occur when a population expands over a territory: this causes genetic changes at the front of the population expansion that we can quantify and study.

I don't consider myself a biologist anymore, but I will always harbor a deep interest for these topics.
