[Here](/assets/docs/CV_academic.pdf) you can find my academic CV. [Here](/assets/docs/CV_notacademic.pdf) you can find a non-academic version of my CV.

I joined the [Centre for Digital Humanities](https://dh.gu.se) at the University of Gothenburg in the Fall of 2022, so I am very fresh in the field. I come with tremendous passion, but lots of ignorance in this specific domain. For the last 8 years, I developed my academic career in a direction that to this day I love and follow, becoming an evolutionary biologist. 

I did my PhD at the University of Bern, working in the [Interfaculty Bioinformatics Unit](https://www.bioinformatics.unibe.ch/index_eng.html) and the [Computational and Molecular Population Genetics](https://www.cmpg.iee.unibe.ch/index_eng.html) lab, under the supervision of [Dr. Stephan Peischl](http://www.bioinformatics.unibe.ch/about_us/staff/dr_peischl_stephan/index_eng.html) and [Prof. Laurent Excoffier](https://www.cmpg.iee.unibe.ch/about_us/team/researchers/prof_dr_excoffier_laurent/index_eng.html). My research there focused on processes of fast adaptation in a spatially explicit context, in particular in populations facing harsh environmental changes. In such situation, the establishment of new mutations is an important aspect in preventing extinction. The survival of an endangered population following the establishment of a beneficial mutation takes the name of “evolutionary rescue”.

After finishing my PhD in 2019, I did a postdoc in the [Bradburd Lab](http://www.genescape.org/) at Michigan State University, where I worked on statistical methods to infer population parameters from genetic data collected in a spatially explicit environment. In 2021, I arrived in Scandinavia as a postdoc in marine evolutionary biology in the [Rafajlović Evolution Modelling Group](https://www.gu.se/en/research/rafajlovic-evolution-modelling-group) at the University of Gothenburg. There, I studied the effects of bottlenecks and allelic surfing during species' range shifts and expansions. In particular I combined mathematical models and simulations with empirical spatially resolved genetic and ecological data from marine species in the Baltic Sea. 

Today, I am still exploring my academic taste in my new position as research engineer in digital humanities. Ever since my high school studies in Latin and Ancient Greek I have nurtured my passion for history, philosophy, politics and all sorts of different arts. I am so grateful to be able to pursue these interests professionally, as I am to have been able to pursue my naturalistic interests in the last decade.  

I have a keen interest in the technical side of the scientific endeavour: that is why in my research I always take time to develop the right tools for different needs. In particular, these tools can be software, algorithms or mathematical and statistical models. This interest unites with the pledge for reproducible science: too often, researchers publish scripts pertaining to a new method that cannot readily be tested and reproduced by other scientists. This is due to a lack of good practices in programming, and also the lack of resources to produce and maintain an open source software. I think that we should enter a new paradigm where we give equal recognition to people who invent new methods and people who create new software. As a community, we should also create resources for open source software. I also recently joined the [Nordic Research Software Engineers association](https://nordic-rse.org), a non-profit organization that aims to bringing together research software engineers and related positions in the Nordic countries in order to establish a network focused on the creation of sustainable software for research.

I am also passionate about teaching: it is the duty of any person with knowledge to try and pass it to other people, and in particular to the new generations. That is why I am always happy to pursue projects of scientific dissemination.

In my free time I like to do sports and to play music. Furthermore, I enjoy studying the art of magic (intended as illusion, not as dark magic); in the words of Spanish magician Miguel Angel Gea, "magic is the emotional disequilibrium of someone who doubts our existence; of someone who tells you that laws of nature are just hearsay, someone who will show you for a moment another possible world". And in some way, I think this description is fitting for Science too: discovering Science is an emotional disequilibrium of someone who doubts your research question. I am the one who want to show you another possible world.
